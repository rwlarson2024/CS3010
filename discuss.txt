The differences between the two algorithms is their accuracy. When conducting tests of different sized matrices and with different values, I noticed a difference in the exact values of the solutions. In the Naive Gaussian Elimination, the values after returning from the program had lost significant digits when compared to high accuracy matrix calculators. When running the Scaled Partial Pivoting, I noticed that there was a higher accuracy when compared to the values from the calculator. The Naive gaussian elimination tends to create more rounding errors when conducted and while the scaled partial pivoting still has to round, the numbers being subtracted are closer in value to there is less of a loss of accuracy in the rounding of the values.
